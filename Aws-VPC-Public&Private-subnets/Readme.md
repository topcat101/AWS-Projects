#Introduction

This AWS project demonstrates that I am currently practising building secure and scalable infrastructure within the cloud, 
by setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets. 
The goal of this was to build hands-on experience with AWS networking while following best practices for security and access management.

The services that I have used are VPCs, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, EC2 Instances, and security groups to design a secure environment. 
Public instances are accessible through the internet gateway (Internet), whilst the private instances, 
can only be reached through the bastion host within the public subnet.
